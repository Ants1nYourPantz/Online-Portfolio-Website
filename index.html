                        <p>A former Paintless Dent Repair technician who's decided to chase a passion into the tech industry. A gamer nerd for almost all genres of games. 
                            An adrenaline junkie with an unscratchable itch for any and all things with two wheels, and most importantly a father to a beautiful son.</p>

                    <div class="answer-2">
                        <p>Growing up I was always into cars and motorcycles both racing them and showing off how cool I could make mine look. A friend of mine worked in the Paintless Dent Repair or "PDR" 
                            industry. He would take dents in cars and repair them to near perfection without using the conventional method of paints and body fillers. Watching him fix cars was fasinating 
                            to me and as someone who's always loved to challenge myself I jumped right into the industry fresh out of highschool. Over a decade later and I managed to climb to one of the 
                            top technician spots in the country, showing skills and repairs that most would deem "beyond repair" or "to severe". I began to grow bored of the career path I had chosen as 
                            it no longer provided me with that challenge I originally chased after. I've also always been fascinated with the way electronics worked. I taught myself how to build PC's, how 
                            to build streams using OBS, and how to adjust audio mixers. Coding is something I've been incredibly curious to learn as it provides me that challenge that I love chasing and 
                            it also fits right into my technical hobbies. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-3">
                        <h4><strong><i>Where would I like coding to take me?</i></strong></h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer-3">
                        <p>I do not have a particular direction that I'm chasing after with learning to code. I think many aspects of coding are incredibly interesting and I would be happy to end up 
                            in any of them. I've always been interested in videogame development so I will probably push hardest into learning those aspects. My son desperately wants to make his own 
                            video game and if I could help him accomplish his goals that's exactly where I want to be.

                    <p>I've always been a two wheeled guy, growing up riding and racing bicyles and motorcycles of all kind. I started riding at 3 years old and 27 years later it's still what I love to do 
                        in my free time. While I don't race anymore I still find my rides to bring me immense peace and I feel the most at home</p>

                    <p>I grew up with video games in my home and 
                        as I got older I found a true passion in how creatively I could express myself through video games. Being a shy person it also gave me a chance to meet new people without the pressure 
                        of face to face contact. I've met a very large portion of my friends through gaming. Gaming also gave me the opportunity to give back to people who need it. Another thing that gaming has blessed me with the opportunity to do is give back to those in need. I've put on multiple fundraisers for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital raising more than $5,000 with no plans to stop anytime soon! Every chance I get to help fight cancer especially in children I'm going to take it.</p>
